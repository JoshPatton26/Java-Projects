# Titration PH Calculator
This is a personal project that I made during my chemistry classes at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
This program allows you to select which type of titration you are performing, how much analyte was added, the 
concentration of the analyte, how much titrant was added, and the concentration of the titrant; which will then
take these values and calculate the PH of your solution. After some rigous testing the calculator proves to have an error rate of about 0.05%
