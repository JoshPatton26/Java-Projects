# Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java projects repository! This repository houses a variety of projects, including assignments from my Algorithms and Data Structures course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, as well as other projects developed using Java.

## Project Overview

### Algorithms and Data Structures Assignments
This section contains assignments related to algorithms and data structures, covering topics such as sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, data structures like linked lists, trees, heaps, and more. These assignments provide practical experience in implementing and understanding fundamental concepts in computer science.

### Other Java Projects
In addition to course assignments, this repository also includes various Java projects developed outside of academic coursework. These projects may cover a wide range of topics, including application development, utilities, games, and more.

## Development Environment

### IDE
All Java projects in this repository were developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight and versatile code editor. VS Code provides a user-friendly interface for writing, debugging, and managing Java projects.

### JavaFX and Scenebuilder
Some projects in this repository utilize JavaFX for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Additionally, Scenebuilder, a drag-and-drop GUI designer for JavaFX, may have been used to design and layout UI components. These tools enhance the visual appeal and functionality of Java applications.

## Running the Projects

Each project directory contains instructions on how to compile and run the code. Depending on the project, you may need to install additional dependencies such as JavaFX libraries. Please refer to the project's README for specific setup instructions.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the projects or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome, whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or optimizing code.
